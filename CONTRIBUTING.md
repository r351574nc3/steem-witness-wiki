Instructions for contributing to the wiki project

## Witnesses

### Join the Github Organization

There's a [github organization for witnesses](https://github.com/steemit-witnesses). Join it by requesting invitation in [steem.chat](https://steem.chat/channel/witness).

Once you have access to the organization, you will automatically be given privileges to the repos in it including privileges to updating the wiki.

### Contribute Changes

The best way to contribute changes to the wiki is by
* Forking the wiki
* Submitting PRs
* Merging PRs

At the end of the week, a witness needs to submit a PR to the `publish` branch
