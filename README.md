# steem-witness-wiki
Wiki for witness documentation

## Motivation 

When trying to setup a full node and a witness, I realized something. I know nothing. This is important because when you're new, you need a hub or a portal that you can go to for details to get you going. Witnesses all are there to help you out, but let's face it. We'd all like to be able to fish on our own. No one wants to be a burden.

This wiki does the following:
1. Provides a way for all witnesses to contribute
1. Reference for Witness API's
1. Reference for Witness commands.
1. Guides and Howto's for basic witness tasks
    * How to become a witness
    * Requirements for a seed node
    * Requirements for a full node
    * How to build a server
    * How to purchase a VPS
1. Links to Witness Updates
1. Portal for updates and information important to witnesses

# Requirements

Some of the requirements for this are:
1. All witnesses need to be able to contribute
1. Denied payout (possibly unless witnesses disagree with this requirement)
1. Feedback from communities
1. Pinnable to witness forums (steem.chat)
1. No central authority (community managed)

# Implementation

The wiki entry point is really a portal/landing page maintained in git. Witnesses can contribute to the wiki by submitting pull requests (PRs) to the [git repository](https://github.com/r351574nc3/steem-witness-wiki).
